A full end-to-end data analysis project examining Klarna's IPO collapse, the BNPL consumer debt crisis, and what $560B in alternative credit tells us about the future of fintech.

## The Question

Klarna IPO'd at $40/share in September 2025 — and fell 65% in five months. At the same time, 41% of BNPL users missed payments in 2025, up from 34% the year before.

Is this a buying opportunity or a warning sign? This project answers that with data.

## Key Findings

**1. Klarna beats revenue estimates but loses money doing it**
Q3 2025: $903M revenue (+26% YoY, beat $882M estimate) — but net loss of −$95M vs +$12M profit a year earlier. GMV is growing. ARPU is declining. The business is scaling volume faster than it can monetise it.

**2. The delinquency paradox**
BNPL's official default rate is 1.83% (CFPB, Dec 2025). But 41% of users self-report late payments. The gap exists because BNPL loans are not reported to credit bureaus, auto-debit obscures true failures, and short repayment windows make "missed" different from "defaulted." The Richmond Fed calls this **phantom debt**.

**3. Gen Z is the canary**
51% of Gen Z BNPL users missed a payment in 2025 — up 7 percentage points year-over-year. These are first-time credit users building financial habits on a product that doesn't build credit history but does charge late fees.

**4. Affirm is outperforming Klarna on every market metric**
AFRM: +12% since Klarna's IPO. KLAR: −51%. Same sector, same macro environment. Affirm's focus on fewer, larger merchants (Amazon, Walmart) with interest-bearing loans creates cleaner, more predictable unit economics.

**5. The regulatory reckoning is coming**
CFPB published major BNPL reports in January and December 2025. The most likely outcome: mandatory credit bureau reporting, which would surface true default rates for the first time and force industry-wide underwriting tightening.
