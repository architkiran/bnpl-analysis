  BNPL UNDER THE MICROSCOPE — FINAL ANALYTICAL VERDICT
=============================================================================

DATA SUMMARY (as of Feb 12, 2026)
----------------------------------
KLAR stock: $19.75  (-51% from IPO price, -65% from ATH of $57.20)
Analyst consensus: Buy | 14 analysts | Avg target $43.29 (+119% upside)
Q3 2025: Revenue $903M (+26% YoY), GMV $32.7B (+25%), Net Loss -$95M
US GMV growth: +43% YoY
Merchants: 850K (+38% YoY). Active users: 114M
Market cap: $7.82B | P/S ratio: ~2.2x

WHAT THE DATA SHOWS
--------------------
1. KLARNA IS FUNDAMENTALLY STRONG but market-structurally broken.
   Revenue growing 26% YoY at $3.5B run rate is genuinely impressive.
   But it IPO'd into peak AI bubble enthusiasm, and the correction has
   been brutal. The business has not deteriorated as much as the stock.

2. THE PROFITABILITY GAP is the real story.
   Q3 net loss -$95M vs prior year +$12M profit = regression.
   ARPU is declining as merchant count surges. Klarna is adding
   volume but not monetising it efficiently. The debit card and
   banking products must drive ARPU recovery to justify the multiple.

3. CONSUMER RISK IS REAL AND GROWING.
   41% of BNPL users missed payments in 2025 (up from 34% in 2024).
   61% are subprime. 63% stack multiple loans simultaneously.
   The CFPB and NY Fed are building groundwork for mandatory credit
   bureau reporting which would force tighter underwriting.

4. AFFIRM IS OUTPERFORMING KLARNA on the public market.
   AFRM: +12% since KLAR IPO. KLAR: -51%. Same sector, same macro.
   Affirm's focus on fewer larger merchants with interest-bearing
   loans creates cleaner more predictable revenue.

VERDICT
--------
Bull:  $43-55 (12-month), driven by Q4 earnings surprise + ARPU recovery
Base:  $20-35 near-term range-bound pending litigation clarity
Bear:  $10-14 if macro deteriorates and BNPL defaults surface
